# Custom-Capacitive-Soil-Moisture-Sensor-with-Advanced-Features

This repository contains the design and firmware for a custom capacitive soil moisture sensor with integrated temperature sensing, low-power operation, and water pump control. Designed for smart irrigation systems, this sensor provides efficient and versatile monitoring and control features.
Key Features:

    Soil Moisture Sensing: Capacitive sensor using LMV358IDR for precise readings.
    Water Level Detection: Integrated with TP5552-VR for accurate water level sensing.
    Temperature Monitoring:
        DS18B20 for digital temperature measurement.
        DHT11 for temperature and humidity sensing.
    Water Pump Control:
        Low-power 5V USB Type-A pump with PWM flow regulation.
        Manual switch for on-demand watering.
    Power Options:
        USB-C for external power or charging.
        CR2032 coin cell battery support with BMS using MAX17048.
    Voltage Regulation:
        Integrated buck converter for stable 5V and 3.3V operation.
    User Interface:
        Two LEDs for status indication.
    Low Power Design:
        Energy-efficient components to maximize battery life.

This project is ideal for home automation enthusiasts and IoT developers looking to build a robust and customizable soil monitoring and watering solution.
